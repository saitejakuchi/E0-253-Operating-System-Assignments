# E0-253-Operating-System-Assignments

- Contains code-patch for Assignments that is done as part of crediting the course.
- Go into the respective folder to find the question, code and results.

- How to build and run
    - Both the assignments makes use of linux-kernel version **6.0.19**. So download the linux kernel from the link provided in one of the question (or from github) and apply the code-patch to run the testcases.
    - The assignments are not dependent on each other as they are solving different problems altogether. Hence, don't apply both the patches together as it may cause conflicts due to using same system-call number for different functions.
